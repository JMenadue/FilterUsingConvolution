# FilterUsingConvolution
Filtering an audio file using convolution.

Part A: Signal manipulation of an audio file, (either record one or use the included audio file) including normalisation, muting and 
applying convolution reverb

Part B: Provides an audio file that includes a high frequency tone with a low frequency melody. The high frequency tone must then be 
identified and filtered out using a low pass filter and convolution.
